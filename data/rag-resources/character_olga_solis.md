# Olga Solis

> “Your life isn’t up there, Elio. It’s down here.”

**Major Olga Solis** is the deuteragonist of the 2025 Disney–Pixar animated feature film *Elio*.  
She is the paternal aunt of **Elio Solis**.

---

## Background

### Official Description
*Olga Solis is a brilliant Major in the Air Force, stationed at Montez Air Force Base.  
Well-respected and highly decorated, Olga had plans to pursue the astronaut program.  
But her career trajectory changed when her nephew, Elio, came to live with her following the loss of his parents.  
Olga’s pivot into parenthood was sudden and not without hiccups—Elio’s passion for space makes him hard to reach sometimes, but she loves him dearly.  
She wants more than anything for him to find his place in the world—as long as it’s on Earth.*

### Development
Olga Solis serves as the emotional anchor in Elio’s Earth-bound storyline, providing familial balance to his cosmic journey.  
Voiced by **Zoë Saldaña**, Olga oversees a classified military operation—likely involving extraterrestrial communication—that Elio intercepts, triggering his abduction by aliens.  

Originally developed as Elio’s **mother** with **America Ferrera** cast in the role, Olga was re-imagined as his **aunt** after a 2024 recast announcement at the *Disney D23 Fan Event*.  
This shift—under directors **Adrian Molina**, **Madeline Sharafian**, and **Domee Shi**—allowed the character to balance authority with compassion, forming a protective familial bond distinct from a parental dynamic.

## Personality

Olga is characterized by intelligence, confidence, and deep protectiveness toward her nephew.  
Her leadership in a top-secret military project highlights her competence and composure under pressure.  
However, her softer, nurturing side surfaces in her interactions with Elio—whom she views as imaginative but vulnerable.  

Her protectiveness manifests through concern for Elio’s safety and her eventual efforts to support him after his abduction, bridging professional expertise with personal loyalty.  
This contrast—her structured, disciplined military world versus Elio’s whimsical, dream-driven outlook—makes Olga a grounding yet empowering influence.

While she dearly loves her nephew, Olga initially struggles to connect with him due to his antisocial tendencies and obsession with aliens.  
Though she doesn’t fully understand his fascination, she accepts it and quietly supports his creative impulses.  
When Elio was replaced by a clone after being abducted, Olga instinctively recognized the impostor due to his behavior and investigated to uncover the truth.  
Upon learning what truly happened, she worked to make contact with the aliens and bring Elio home.

## Physical Appearance

Olga has a disciplined, military appearance, wearing an **Air Force OCP (Operational Camouflage Pattern)** uniform with **O-4 Major Rank** insignia and a sleeve patch referencing **Air Force Space Command**.  
Her dark hair is tied neatly in a low bun, emphasizing precision and professionalism.  
She wears small stud earrings, adding subtle warmth to her utilitarian look.  
Her medium-brown complexion reflects the Solis family’s heritage, while her expressive eyes convey both strength and empathy—especially in emotional moments shared with Elio.  

Her surroundings often emphasize this duality: Elio’s room, filled with alien-themed posters and glow-in-the-dark stars, contrasts with Olga’s disciplined composure, highlighting the emotional distance she strives to bridge.

## Trivia

- **America Ferrera** was originally cast as Olga (then written as Elio’s mother) but departed due to scheduling conflicts; **Zoë Saldaña** replaced her, leading to the character’s rewrite as Elio’s aunt.  
- Olga’s surname **Solis**, meaning “sun” in Latin, mirrors Elio’s name—together signifying “Sun Sun,” symbolizing their familial connection.  
- Her uniform design is a stylized adaptation of the **Operational Camouflage Pattern** used by the **U.S. Air Force** and **Space Force**.  
- Saldaña’s casting added science-fiction gravitas, consistent with her previous roles in *Avatar* and *Guardians of the Galaxy*.  
- Elio’s room, where Olga frequently appears, includes alien posters, a “KEEP OUT” sign, and glow-in-the-dark stars foreshadowing her concern for him before his interstellar journey.  
- The **unit patch** combined with the Air Force tag sets the story **pre-2019**, before the Space Force separated from Air Force Space Command.
