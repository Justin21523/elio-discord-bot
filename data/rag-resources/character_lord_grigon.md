# Lord Grigon

> “If I cannot join the Communiverse, then I shall take it by force! Prepare to be conquered!”  
> — Lord Grigon to the Communiverse leaders

**Lord Grigon** is the main antagonist of the 2025 Disney–Pixar animated feature film *Elio*.  
He is the war-mongering, power-obsessed ruler of the planet **Hylurg** and the father of **Glordon**, who befriends the human boy **Elio Solis**.

## Background

### Official Description
*For Grigon, every waking moment of his life is a battle for him. From eating his mother when he was alive to working his way up to being the Lord and Chief Ambassador of Hylurg to taking the supposed ruler of “Uh-Earth,” Elio Solis, under his wing to teach him about the ins-and-outs of the Communiverse, there’s no challenge Grigon finds himself unable for.*

## Personality

Grigon is portrayed as a harsh, ruthless, and war-driven ruler who commits massacres on the planets he conquers.  
His bloodthirsty tendencies are shown through acts such as using flower-like alien creatures for target practice and slaughtering dozens to vent his anger.  
He collects the skulls of his fallen enemies and encases them in amber as trophies of war.

Grigon’s most defining trait is his short temper. He lashes out whenever he doesn’t get what he wants—most notably when the Communiverse denies his membership, prompting him to vow conquest by force.  
He also loses control when insulted or tricked, as seen when he imprisons Elio aboard his flagship for unintentionally calling him a bad father.

Despite his violence, Grigon possesses a strong sense of **Hylurgian honor** and keeps his promises.  
When he vows to leave the Communiverse alone if his son Glordon is returned safely, he keeps his word—at least until he discovers Elio’s deception.  
Ultimately, he forgives Elio and others after witnessing Elio’s bravery in saving Glordon’s life, freeing the captured ambassadors and apologizing for the chaos he caused.

Grigon has a complicated but heartfelt relationship with his son.  
Though often distant and dismissive, he genuinely cares for Glordon’s safety and shows affection beneath his militant exterior.  
When Glordon reveals he does not want to follow in his father’s footsteps, Grigon ultimately accepts him, declaring that even if he doesn’t always understand him, he will always love him.

## Physical Appearance

Grigon is a towering, decapod-like alien resembling a heavily armored crustacean.  
He has multiple limbs, glowing red eyes, and wears a massive **weaponized mech suit** featuring pulsating red armor plates.  
His presence radiates intimidation and raw power, reflecting his dominance as both emperor and warlord of Hylurg.

## Role in the Film

Grigon first appears demanding **membership in the Communiverse**, boasting that his technology would make them invincible.  
When denied due to his destructive nature, he swears to conquer the coalition by force.

Elio later travels to Grigon’s flagship to negotiate peace.  
At first, the discussion goes smoothly—Grigon is impressed by Elio’s accidental “trick shot” and resonates with his talk of belonging.  
However, the meeting collapses after Grigon misinterprets Elio’s remarks about fatherhood as an insult, leading to a violent outburst.  
He imprisons Elio, vowing to annihilate the Communiverse.

Elio later escapes, taking **Glordon** as a “bargaining chip.”  
He demands that Grigon leave the Communiverse in exchange for his son’s safety.  
Tortured by his son’s laughter during the exchange, Grigon reluctantly swears on his Hylurgian honor to withdraw—warning Elio never to harm Glordon.

To prove Hylurg’s might, Grigon later arrives at the Communiverse with an army, intending to conduct Glordon’s **warrior ceremony**.  
However, he becomes suspicious when the “Glordon” presented behaves unnaturally, revealing it to be a **clone**.  
Furious, Grigon forces **Ambassador Questa** to read Elio’s mind, uncovering the truth.  
Upon learning that his real son has been transported to Earth, he launches an assault on the Communiverse until Glordon is found.

In the climax, as Elio and Olga return with Glordon near death, Grigon witnesses Elio’s heroism and repents.  
He releases his captives, apologizes to the Communiverse, and reconciles with his son.

  - Both Grigon and Elio yearn for acceptance but are shunned for their natures.  
  - Both Grigon and Olga attempt to change their children but later learn to embrace them as they are.  
- Grigon’s title **“Scourge of the Crab Nebula”** suggests this may be the location of his homeworld.
