## Background

### Official Description
*Elio is an 11-year-old who doesn’t feel like he fits in on Earth. He loves his Aunt Olga, and he knows she loves him, too, but she doesn’t really get him. “Elio’s parents passed away when he was younger,” says producer Mary Alice Drumm. “He’s lonely. He sees this magnificence in space—the promise of life—and he puts all his energy into that. He really believes that’s where he’ll find true connection.”*

## Personality

In the beginning, Elio starts off as a depressed and lonely boy, deeply affected by his parents’ deaths.  
When he developed a fascination with aliens and outer space, Elio used these interests to escape from reality and his grief.  
His interest in aliens and grief also caused him to isolate himself from his aunt Olga and anyone who tried to befriend him, as he felt nobody would understand or accept him like his parents did before they died.  
Because of this belief, Elio selfishly did not consider Olga his family, thinking she only saw him as a burden and that if he were to meet aliens of different species, they would accept him for his weirdness and nonconformity unlike anyone on Earth.

Elio is rambunctious with his powerful passion for space, or more specifically, extraterrestrial life.  
He is prone to hyperactive habits to pursue this passion. Beneath his enthusiasm and energy, Elio is a depressed boy with insecurities and fears of being rejected and unloved.  
Though he has shown signs of being self-centered, he is ultimately a kind-hearted child who desperately wants to connect with people.

When abducted by aliens, Elio was overjoyed to meet real aliens and was fascinated with their lifestyle in the **Communiverse**.  
However, upon realizing the aliens mistook him as an ambassador for Earth, Elio was shocked and instead of correcting the misunderstanding, he embraced the role out of a desire to be seen as someone important.  
As a result, Elio went through many lengths to keep his façade as he desired to stay in the Communiverse, where he negotiated with **Lord Grigon** (which ended in poor results), pretended to kidnap his son, and attempted to replace him with a clone to spare him from disappointing his father.  
However, when Elio’s lies were exposed by **Ambassador Questa** after she forcefully read his mind, he tried to explain himself, and only after he saw the Communiverse get attacked and was pushed through a portal back to Earth did he realize how his lies and determination for acceptance had caused harm to others.

When meeting **Glordon**, Elio formed a bond with the young alien—something he thought he was incapable of doing with anyone on Earth.  
During their time together, Elio and Glordon found kindred spirits in each other due to their statuses as outcasts and having complicated relationships with their parental guardians.  
Through this friendship and his time in the Communiverse, Elio became a selfless, social, and open-hearted individual who could express his feelings and relate to **Olga** and **Bryce**, who had tried to befriend him earlier.  
Upon seeing Olga working to send a message to the aliens for his return, Elio managed to reconcile with his aunt after she expressed her love for him—and how despite giving up her dreams when his parents died, she still wanted him no matter what.

Once he discovered Glordon to be on the verge of dying after crashing on Earth, Elio risked his life to save him.  
After Glordon was revived by Grigon, Elio encouraged his friend to resist becoming a war machine, allowing father and son to reconcile.  
Because of Elio’s heroism, he was awarded membership in the Communiverse, making him overjoyed.  
However, upon seeing Olga heartbroken, Elio realized the importance of family and how deep his bond with his aunt truly is.  
This caused Elio to maturely turn down the title of ambassador, recognizing that he still had a lot of growing up to do and needed to give Earth and other people a chance so he could build a fulfilling life and form strong relationships at home.

As a result, Elio is able to move on from his parents’ deaths, strengthen his bond with Olga, become friends with Bryce, and maintain his friendship with Glordon by keeping in contact with him.

## Physical Appearance

Elio is a short pre-teen boy with lightly tanned skin, brown eyes, dark brown wavy hair, and light freckles across his nose and cheeks.  
He wears a light green T-shirt with a green alien head on it, dark green shorts, a green bracelet, white socks with a green line, and dark blue shoes with white laces and brown soles.

He also wears a modified metal colander as a helmet and a large violet cape decorated with colorful plastic spoons, forks, and knives, featuring green designs on the back.  
For most of the film, he wears a blue eye patch on his left eye (after being hit with a radio during the fight with bullies) until the end of the movie.  
He has a mole in the shape of the Orion Nebula on his stomach.

For his camp outfit, Elio wears a scout uniform consisting of an indigo short-sleeved button-up shirt, gray cargo shorts, dark green socks, black shoes with brown soles, and a tan sash.

## Role in the Film

Elio is first seen sitting under a restaurant table with his aunt persistently suggesting meals for him to choose, with no luck.  
Olga is then spotted by another woman, and after overhearing them discuss an astronaut program, Elio decides to try out for it and wanders away into a dark room.  
He spots a gold disk labeled “VOYAGER GOLDEN RECORD” and presses the circular gold button for the “O” in “VOYAGER,” which plays a recording describing the mission to travel to the cosmos and beyond.

A worried Olga finds Elio lying on the floor.  
He asks if life is really out there, pointing at a hologram of the solar system.  
Olga tells him he can’t run away from her like that. They leave as Elio looks back at the replica of Voyager above him.

Later, Elio draws a diagram in the sand reading “ALIENS! ABDUCT ME!!” and spends days trying to attract attention from outer space.  
One night, he’s awakened by a light that scares a hermit crab off his face—it turns out to be **Bryce**, who offers to join Elio’s ham-radio club.  
Bryce’s friend **Caleb** soon arrives and mocks him; a fight breaks out over the radio, injuring Elio’s left eye.  
He must then wear an eye patch.

After this incident, Olga reprimands Elio, worried about his obsession.  
At the military base, Elio overhears **Gunther Melmac** discussing alien signals and secretly sends a message of his own, which shuts down the power grid.  
Olga is furious, warning him that his stunt nearly cost her job.  
She decides to send Elio to Camp Carver to learn discipline and make friends.  
Feeling rejected, Elio declares Olga isn’t his family and retreats in anger.

At camp, Elio reunites with Bryce and Caleb.  
While he struggles to fit in, his alien transmission is received, leading to his abduction.  
These events set the stage for his journey through the **Communiverse** and his eventual transformation.

## Trivia

- Elio Solis was originally intended to be a queer-coded character who did not adhere to stereotypical ideas of masculinity, having interests in fashion and environmentalism.
