# Elio (2025 film)

**Elio** is a 2025 American animated science fiction adventure film produced by **Pixar Animation Studios** for **Walt Disney Pictures**. Directed by **Madeline Sharafian**, **Domee Shi**, and **Adrian Molina**, and written by **Julia Cho**, **Mark Hammer**, and **Mike Jones**, from a story developed by Molina, Sharafian, Shi, and Cho, the film stars the voices of **Yonas Kibreab**, **Zoë Saldaña**, **Remy Edgerly**, **Dylan Gilmer**, **Matthias Schweighöfer**, **Brandon Moon**, **Brad Garrett**, and **Jameela Jamil**. It follows an eleven-year-old boy named **Elio Solís** (Kibreab) who is mistaken for the intergalactic ambassador of Earth after being beamed up to the **Communiverse** by aliens for making contact, and must navigate a crisis that involves the warlord father of an alien he befriended.

*Elio* was conceived by Molina as a story about childhood and social isolation and was inspired by growing up on a military base and his eventual enrollment at the **California Institute of the Arts**. The film was officially announced in September 2022, with Molina attached to direct. Molina later left the project to work on *Coco 2* (2029), and in August 2024, it was announced that Shi and Sharafian would replace him as lead directors. The production team devised a process, titled the "**College Project**", to create the look of the space setting, the Communiverse. The film was shot with a **virtual anamorphic lens** and Pixar's new **Luna** lighting toolset was used to quickly define lighting and the overall aesthetic. Its musical score was composed by **Rob Simonsen**.

*Elio* premiered at the **El Capitan Theatre** in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on **June 10, 2025**, and was theatrically released in the United States on **June 20**. Although the film received positive reviews from critics, it **underperformed at the box office**, grossing **$154 million** worldwide against an estimated budget of **$150–200 million**.

## Plot

After the death of his parents, young Elio Solís is orphaned and lives with his aunt Olga, an **Air Force** major who gave up her dreams of becoming an astronaut to raise her nephew. On an outing to a museum, Elio wanders into a closed exhibit on the **Voyager 1** spacecraft, where he is awed by the idea of discovering other life in space.

Years later, Elio wishes to be abducted by aliens. Every day, he lies on the beach waiting, but without result. One night, a kid named **Bryce** and his bully friend **Caleb** tamper with Elio's **ham radio**, leading to a fight that injures his left eye. At Olga's workplace, Elio sneaks into an emergency meeting where conspiracy theorist **Gunther Melmac** claims to have detected an alien response to *Voyager*, but is dismissed by Olga and her colleagues. Elio uses Melmac's device to send a message, causing a power outage at the military base, nearly costing Olga her job. Olga decides to send him to a youth camp, which he dreads, as Bryce and Caleb are also there.

At camp, Elio escapes from Bryce, Caleb, and other bullies as they attempt to scare him. Back at the military base, Olga receives strange extraterrestrial messages in response to Elio, who is then abducted by an alien ship. Inside the spaceship, **Ooooo**, a liquid supercomputer, welcomes him to the **Communiverse**, a place where aliens from different worlds share their knowledge. Other ambassadors mistakenly declare him a candidate for ambassador, thinking he is the leader of Earth and that he created the *Voyager* spacecraft. Before Elio can clarify, **Lord Grigon**, a warlord previously rejected by the Communiverse, arrives to take the Communiverse by force. The ambassadors plan to return Elio to Earth while they resolve the crisis, but Elio volunteers to negotiate with Grigon in return for induction as an ambassador. Ooooo creates a **clone** of Elio to take his place back on Earth. Olga brings **Other Elio** home from camp after hearing about the fight.

Meanwhile, Elio attempts to negotiate with Grigon, but is imprisoned after unintentionally angering him. While trying to escape, he encounters Grigon's son, **Glordon**, and decides to use him as a bargaining chip to convince Grigon to leave the Communiverse alone. They head back to the Communiverse, where Elio gives Glordon a disc that regulates his body temperature. Grigon agrees to leave them in peace in exchange for Glordon's safe return.

Elio and Glordon confide in each other; Elio is lonely and feels misunderstood by his aunt, while Glordon resists becoming a war machine like his father. Elio devises a plan to keep them together; he hides the real Glordon in an escape shuttle while giving a clone to Grigon, but Grigon quickly realizes the deception. He compels the mind-reading Ambassador **Questa** to extract Glordon's location from Elio and sends troops to retrieve his son. Questa, realizing Elio is a regular kid, returns him to Earth. Meanwhile, Glordon accidentally activates the shuttle, heading toward Earth.

Back home, Elio is devastated but soon spots his aunt on the beach looking for him with Other Elio, whom she had already suspected was not her real nephew. After reconciling, they head to the military base, where Glordon's shuttle has been captured. Other Elio sacrifices himself to distract the military, while Elio and Olga sneak into the base to rescue Glordon, who is now suffering from hypothermia after his disc broke upon landing. They pilot the shuttle back to the Communiverse, calling Bryce, Melmac, and worldwide **ham radio** enthusiasts for help traveling through a debris field.

Reaching the Communiverse, they return Glordon to Grigon, who rips his warsuit open to swaddle him, saving his life, and apologizes to his son and the ambassadors. Elio is welcomed back into the Communiverse, but declines the offer, deciding that Earth is his home, and bids his friends farewell before returning to Earth with Olga.

## Production

### Development

In September 2022, during the **D23 Expo**, Pixar Animation Studios announced a new original film titled *Elio*, with **Adrian Molina** set to direct and **Mary Alice Drumm** set to produce. [10] It would have marked Molina's feature-length solo directorial debut after having co-directed and co-written *Coco* (2017). Molina and Drumm posed the question, "What if I told you we're not alone in the universe, and everything you've ever heard about aliens is true?" Shortly after the announcement, a planned screen glitch delivered a message with alien text saying, "**Bring us to your leader.**" [21]

The film was conceived by Molina as a "personal coming-of-age story about youthful alienation." [12] Molina was inspired by his childhood growing up at a military base and eventual enrollment at the **California Institute of the Arts** when developing the film's story. Director **Madeline Sharafian** described his feelings on the private art school by saying "he felt like he'd found his people there, he'd found his world". [22] After working on the project for a couple of years, Molina felt like he "ultimately wasn't the one to see it to the finish line," exiting the film in order to work on *Coco 2* (2029). [23]

In June 2024, Pixar's chief creative officer **Pete Docter** revealed that *Turning Red* (2022) director **Domee Shi** was working on the film. [24] She was officially announced as the new director at the D23 fan event in August 2024, alongside **Madeline Sharafian**, who previously worked on storyboarding the film. [12][25] The screenplay was written by **Julia Cho**, **Mark Hammer**, and **Mike Jones**; Cho previously co-wrote *Turning Red*, while Jones co-wrote Pixar's *Soul* (2020) and *Luca* (2021). [26] During production, when researching the topic of loneliness, the directors talked to psychologists, including **Vivek Murthy**, about children's loneliness and grief. [27][28] Sharafian said that "everybody's feeling it, and as we were learning more about it as a crew, we started to realize, we're like, 'Wait a minute. I'm really lonely right now'." [29]

In June 2025, multiple insiders who worked at Pixar spoke to **The Hollywood Reporter** about the film. They noted that characterizations of Elio as a "queer-coded character" were removed as the film moved through the production process, with a push by Pixar executives to make Elio "more masculine," removing examples of his love of fashion and environmentalism, including after Adrian Molina departed the film as director, replaced by Madeline Sharafian and Domee Shi. Some expressed disappointment at the first cut of the movie shared by Sharafian and Shi, with one employee stating that the changes "destroyed this beautiful work" while another described the final version of *Elio* as "much more generic" as compared to previous versions. Reports that some employees left after Molina departed were disputed by another Pixar source. One former artist told the publication that executives were "constantly sanding down" moments which alluded to Elio's queer sexuality, engaging in "obeying-in-advance behavior" and that changes to the film made it about "totally nothing," describing the film's production as "something of a cautionary tale"—wondering if the "rewrite was worth it." The same source claimed that **America Ferrera**, who left the film's cast after Molina's departure, was "upset that there was no longer Latinx representation in the leadership" of the film. [3]

### Casting

In September 2022, during the D23 Expo, **America Ferrera** and **Yonas Kibreab** were announced in the leading voice roles of **Olga Solis** and **Elio**, respectively. [10] When Kibreab originally auditioned for the role, he recorded his audition in his parents' closet and received an email a month later for a scratch role. [30] While recording his lines, Kibreab stated that "it was Elio who really helped me. I just had to think of Elio’s story. There were so many deep things for me," adding that he relates to the character's loneliness. [9][30]

In June 2023, with the release of the first teaser trailer and poster, **Jameela Jamil** and **Brad Garrett** joined the voice cast. [31] In August 2024, Docter stated that **Ferrera** had withdrawn due to scheduling conflicts; parts of her voice acting still remain in the first teaser trailer. As a result, the character of Olga was rewritten as Elio's aunt and Ferrera was replaced by **Zoë Saldaña**. [32][33][34] In November 2024, with the release of the second teaser trailer and poster, **Remy Edgerly** and **Shirley Henderson** joined the cast as **Glordon** and **Ooooo**, respectively. [35]

### Animation, design and cinematography

*Elio* marks the final Pixar film from veteran production designer **Harley Jessup**, who collaborated with visual effects supervisor **Claudia Chung Sanii** to create the look of the Communiverse. [12] The goal was to create a version of space unlike any other on screen—translucent, luminescent, and with loosely defined gravity to accommodate different alien species. [12] Jessup referred to the creative process as the "**College Project**". **VR** and macro photography in water tanks were used, with one test shot recorded in a drinking glass at a Pixar studio party; another used oil and water in a glass bowl on sequins and glitter. [12]

For the aliens, the team researched **microscopic plants and animals** to capture an odd but believable vibe. [12] Glordon's design was influenced by larval insects and microbiotic creatures like **tardigrades**, balancing cute and creepy and making him expressive **without eyes**. [12] **Ooooo**, a liquid, shapeshifting supercomputer, was a major technical challenge; her fluidity was refined via **2D animation tests**, with facial rigging techniques learned from the series *Win or Lose* (2025). [12]

Pixar's **Luna** lighting toolset allowed the team to define lighting and camera simultaneously and lock the aesthetic early. [12] The directors and cinematographers **Derek Williams** and **Jordan Rempel** crafted a visual language inspired by classic Spielberg sci-fi (*E.T.* and *Close Encounters*) and R-rated horrors (*Alien*, *The Thing*), employing calculated dark shadows, mist, and glow for a dreamy atmosphere. [36] The film was shot using a **virtual anamorphic lens**, with "real cameras the same way a live-action film would," including small artifacts like a red ring around a light. [36]

### Music

In **November 2024**, **Rob Simonsen** was announced to compose the score—his first animated feature. [37][38] Simonsen joined about **2.5 years** before release, resonating strongly with the story; each major setting received a unique musical identity. [38] The soundtrack album was released by **Walt Disney Records** on **June 20, 2025**. [39]

[41] It was originally scheduled for **March 1, 2024**, but on **October 27, 2023**, the film was delayed to **June 13, 2025**. [43] **Pete Docter** stated on **August 9, 2024** that the delay was due in part to the **2023 SAG-AFTRA strike** as well as leadership changes at Pixar. [32] On **February 14, 2025**, *Elio* was delayed one week later to avoid competition with *How to Train Your Dragon* (2025). [41]

### Marketing

Following the project announcement, first look concept art was released on **September 9, 2022**. [10][21]  
- The **first teaser trailer** (June 13, 2023) featured **“Good Feeling”** by **Austin French**. [44]

- A **longer trailer** was released on **March 19, 2025**. [46]

On **June 16, 2025**, a cross-promotional short featured **Phineas and Ferb** contacting Elio and Glordon. [47] On **June 30, 2025**, Pixar released an online series of **in-universe bloopers**, echoing *A Bug's Life* (1998), *Toy Story 2* (1999), and *Monsters, Inc.* (2001). [48][49]

### Home media

*Elio* released for digital purchase on **August 19, 2025**, and on **Ultra HD Blu-ray**, **Blu-ray**, and **DVD** on **September 9, 2025**. [50] It streamed on **Disney+** on **September 17**. [51]

The film ranked **No. 9** on the U.S. combined DVD/Blu-ray sales chart for September 2025. [52] **Samba TV** reported *Elio* attracted **368%** more U.S. households on Disney+ in its first five days compared to its PVOD debut. [53] **Nielsen** reported **550 million minutes** streamed from **Sept 15–21**, ranking **third** for the week. [54][55]

## Reception

### Box office

As of **September 7, 2025**, *Elio* has grossed **$73 million** in the United States and Canada, and **$81 million** in other territories, for a worldwide total of **$154 million**. [4][5]

In the U.S. and Canada, it released alongside *28 Years Later* and was initially projected to gross around **$30 million** opening weekend from 3,750 theaters. [56][57] It made **$9 million** on its first day (including **$3 million** in previews), and debuted to **$20.8 million**, third behind *How to Train Your Dragon* and *28 Years Later*, becoming the **lowest opening weekend for a Pixar film**. [58][59] Analysts attributed the low opening to competition and broader challenges for original Pixar films post-pandemic, though potential legs were noted (citing *Elemental*). [58][60][61] Subsequent weekends were **$10.4m** (−50%), **$5.8m** (−44.5%), and **$4m**—crossing **$100m** worldwide after a month; *Variety* projected it would be "a major money loser for Disney and Pixar". [62][63][64][65]

### Critical response

- **Rotten Tomatoes:** **83%** of 225 critics’ reviews positive; consensus: *"Catapulted by its theme of building self-esteem, Pixar's latest cosmic wonder Elio boasts a fanciful world of original creations to dazzling effect."* [66]  
- **Metacritic:** **66/100** based on 40 critics (“generally favorable”). [67]  
- **CinemaScore:** **A**; **PostTrak:** **83%** overall positive; **59%** would definitely recommend. [58]

Selected reviews:
- **Ty Burr (The Washington Post):** Three stars out of four; praises emotional core and friendships. [68]
- **Peter Debruge (Variety):** Notes fun buddy-movie shift; says it lacks some of Pixar’s hallmark surprise. [69]
- **Carlos Aguilar (IGN):** Commends humor, animation, aliens; wishes some ideas had more screen time. [70]
- **Kyle Smith (The Wall Street Journal):** Warm, sumptuous animation; “no place like home.” [71]
- **Laura Venning (Empire):** “*Contact* for kids…” visually inventive adventure. [72]
- **Manohla Dargis (NYT):** Calls it “lackluster” once novelty fades. [73]
- **Angie Han (THR):** “Perfectly nice kiddie sci-fi,” but not transportive. [74]
- **Richard Lawson (Vanity Fair):** Lush animation; feels repetitive for Pixar. [75]
