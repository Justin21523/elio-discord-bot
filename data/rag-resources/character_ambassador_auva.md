# Ambassador Auva

**Ambassador Auva** is a character in the 2025 Disney–Pixar animated feature film *Elio*.

## Background

### Official Description
*Ambassador Auva is the bubbly and passionate leader of a peace-loving planet and the creator of The Universal Users’ Manual.  
She’s all about positive vibes, so it’s no surprise when she votes against Lord Grigon’s inclusion in the Communiverse.*  

“*With her ink-splat face, Auva doesn’t emote easily,*” says producer **Mary Alice Drumm**. “*So, she was a challenge.*”

## Personality

Auva is an expressive yet composed figure who radiates warmth and positivity.  
Her demeanor embodies **optimism and empathy**, and she believes in unity through communication rather than conflict.  
Despite her playful energy, Auva can also exhibit seriousness and firm resolve when faced with moral or diplomatic dilemmas within the **Communiverse Council**.

## Physical Appearance

Auva resembles a **caterpillar-like alien** with a unique **flat red face** featuring a **black ink-like spot** at its center.  
Her facial mark **shapeshifts dynamically** depending on her emotions, acting as a visual mood indicator.  
This “ink-splat” design was considered a creative challenge for the animation team due to the limited facial features that still needed to convey complex emotion.
