# Glordon

> “Hi, Dad! I’m a Bargaining Chip!”  
> — Glordon to his father Lord Grigon

**Glordon** is the tritagonist of the 2025 Disney–Pixar animated feature film *Elio*.  
He is a Hylurgian boy, the son of **Lord Grigon**, who befriends **Elio Solis** and accompanies him on adventures throughout the **Communiverse**.

## Background

### Official Description
*Glordon is the tenderhearted son of Grigon, the warlord ruler of the planet Hylurg. Gregarious and kind, the princeling is about to be installed in his fearsome battle armor and take his rightful place at his father’s side. Glordon says he’s excited about his future because that’s what he’s supposed to say and feel. But as Elio’s unexpected first friend—and surprise bargaining chip—Glordon might feel comfortable divulging his deepest secret to his new buddy.*

## Physical Appearance

Like most Hylurgians, Glordon resembles a **purple-skinned tardigrade-like alien** with no eyes, four arms, eight legs, and multiple sharp teeth in every part of his mouth.  
He has a **greenish-black carapace** with glowing blue spots scattered across his body, giving him a bioluminescent appearance.  
His round body and short limbs emphasize his youthful nature and visual contrast with his father, Lord Grigon.

## Personality

Glordon embodies a naive yet sweet personality.  
Unlike his father and the rest of his species, he is friendly, empathetic, and uninterested in following a warrior’s path.  
Initially, Glordon pretends to share his people’s militaristic traditions, but he secretly rejects them—fearing he will disappoint his father for not embracing intergalactic conquest.  

Though he mentions having a close bond with his mother, Glordon suffers from deep-seated insecurity and fear of rejection.  
He believes that if he fails to live up to Grigon’s expectations, his father would no longer view him as worthy.  

Despite his anxieties, Glordon is selfless and compassionate.  
He helps Elio maintain his ambassador façade and even **pretends to be kidnapped** to stop his father from attacking the Communiverse.  
When near death, he uses his last ounce of strength to save Elio and **Olga Solis** as they struggle through a debris field to return home.  

Socially, Glordon is far more expressive and emotional than his father.  
Although he has few friends and spends most of his time alone, his encounter with Elio transforms him.  
He relates to Elio’s grief over his parents’ deaths, providing empathy and comfort.  
Their friendship helps him accept himself and voice his wish to live freely rather than become a warrior.

## Trivia

- Glordon shares thematic similarities with **Stitch** from *Lilo & Stitch*—both characters resist the destinies imposed upon them.  
  Lord Grigon wanted Glordon to become a warlord, while Jumba created Stitch for destruction. Both ultimately found friendship with a human child.  
- When Elio enters Glordon’s mouth in the lava tunnels, Glordon continues speaking despite his mouth being full, implying that **Hylurgians communicate via deep growls rather than lip movements**.  
- Due to having no eyes, **Glordon is capable of crying through his mouth**.
