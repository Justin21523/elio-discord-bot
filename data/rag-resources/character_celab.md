# Caleb

**Caleb** is the secondary antagonist in the 2025 Disney–Pixar animated feature film *Elio*.  
He is a middle schooler from Montez and often seen alongside his friend **Bryce**. Unlike Bryce, Caleb possesses a cruel and manipulative demeanor, serving as one of the key instigators of Elio’s bullying.

## Background

### Personality

Caleb is characterized by his **vindictive, arrogant, and domineering personality**.  
As a leader among his peers, he uses manipulation to coerce others—particularly **Bryce Markwell**—into joining his schemes.  
He is insensitive to the emotions of others and takes pleasure in belittling those he sees as weak, including **Elio Solis**.  

Throughout the story, Caleb demonstrates a lack of empathy, mocking Elio’s grief over his parents’ deaths and ignoring Bryce’s reluctance to bully him.  
While he serves as a catalyst for Elio’s early hardships, Caleb’s actions indirectly contribute to Elio’s journey toward self-discovery after the events that follow his abduction.

## Physical Appearance

Caleb is a medium-sized teenage boy with fair skin, spiked blonde hair, and sharp facial features.  
His default outfit consists of a **blue shirt** marked with **three red claw-like stripes**, **dark blue shorts with indigo trim**, **gray socks**, and **black sneakers**.  
In his scout uniform, Caleb wears a **blue shirt decorated with multiple merit badges**, nearly identical to Bryce’s attire, symbolizing their shared membership in the same youth group.

## Role in the Film

Caleb first appears when **Bryce** greets **Elio** on the beach.  
After hearing mysterious sounds from the **ham radio**, Elio warns Caleb not to touch it—but Caleb provokes him anyway, resulting in a fight that leaves Elio with an injury to his left eye.  
This altercation is interrupted by the **Montez Air Force Base** personnel, foreshadowing the boy’s later entanglement in Elio’s cosmic journey.

He reappears at **Camp Carver**, where he and Bryce attempt to bully Elio again, with Caleb leading the charge.  
He coerces other campers into wearing masks to frighten Elio. Just as Caleb is about to physically attack him, time freezes, and a UFO abducts Elio, transporting him to the **Communiverse**.  
Afterward, a clone of Elio is placed on Earth, prompting **Olga Solis** to expel Caleb from camp for his behavior.

Later, during the film’s conclusion, Bryce apologizes to Elio and distances himself from Caleb.  
Though Caleb’s ultimate fate remains ambiguous, it is implied that he was punished for his cruelty and ostracized from the group—serving as a cautionary mirror to Elio’s own emotional growth.
