## Background

### Official Description
*Ambassador Questa is the leader of the planet Gom and one of the highest-ranking members of the Communiverse.  
A 15-foot-tall leafy sea dragon with a soothing voice, Questa is an optimist looking to discover the best in every lifeform she meets.  
Extremely intuitive, with the ability to read minds, Questa is all about intense eye contact and has no concept of personal space.  
Her keen intuition and empathy guide her in the most complex of Communiverse quandaries.*

## Personality

Questa is a kind-hearted and empathetic leader who embodies optimism and open-mindedness.  
As the **Chief Ambassador of Gom**, she travels across the Communiverse to form friendships with diverse extraterrestrial species.  
Her personality blends diplomacy and intuition, allowing her to connect with others on emotional and psychic levels.  

She befriends **Elio Solis**, the mistaken “head of Uh-Earth,” and becomes one of his greatest allies.
