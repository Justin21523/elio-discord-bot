## Synopsis

What if the thing you were searching for found you first?
In Pixar Animation Studios' big-screen comedic misadventure, alien-obsessed Elio discovers the answer to that question when he is transported to the **Communiverse**, an interplanetary paradise that is home to intelligent life from galaxies far and wide.
But when he's mistaken as Earth's leader, he'll have to form unexpected bonds, navigate a crisis of intergalactic proportions, and make sure he doesn't lose the opportunity to live out his ultimate dream.

## Plot

After the death of his parents, young **Elio Solis** is orphaned and is taken in by his aunt **Olga**, an Air Force major who gave up her dreams of becoming an astronaut to raise her nephew. Elio wanders into a closed exhibit on the **Voyager 1 spacecraft**, where he is awed by the idea of discovering other life in space.

Years later, Elio wishes to be abducted by aliens believing he doesn't belong on Earth but rather in space. Every day, he lies on the beach waiting, but without result. After Elio puts up flyers about a ham radio club, a boy named **Bryce** brings his own radio to the beach one night in hopes of joining the "club". Elio calibrates the radio and tries to get Bryce to leave, but they are joined by Bryce's friend, **Caleb**. Caleb insists on looking at the radios, leading to a fight that injures Elio's left eye and leaves his ham radio damaged. This forces Elio to wear a patch over his eye for two weeks.

At Olga's workplace, Elio sneaks into an emergency meeting where conspiracy theorist **Gunther Melmac** claims to have found evidence of aliens responding to Voyager, suggesting they send a message back, but is dismissed by Olga and her colleagues. Elio uses Melmac's device to send his message, causing a power outage at the military base, nearly costing Olga her job. Elio doesn't seem to care that he did something wrong but is only excited about the arrival of the aliens. To get him to snap out of his alien obsession, she tells him firmly there are no aliens out there and he belongs here on Earth with his family. Unfortunately, Elio tells her out of hurt and anger that they are not family. Angered by Elio's actions and to set him straight, Olga decides to send him to a youth camp, which he dreads, as Bryce and Caleb are also there.

At camp, Elio escapes from Bryce, Caleb, and two other bullies one night as they attempt to scare him. Back at the military base, Olga receives strange outer space messages in response to Elio. Just as Elio faces a beating, an alien ship arrives and abducts him. Inside the spaceship, he meets **Ooooo**, a liquid supercomputer, and is welcomed to the **Communiverse**, where aliens share knowledge and technology from their worlds. Ambassadors **Helix**, **Questa**, and **Tegmen** mistakenly declare him a candidate for ambassador, under the assumption that he is Earth's leader who created the Voyager spacecraft. Before Elio can clarify, they attend an emergency meeting with **Lord Grigon**, a Hylurgian warlord who demands to be made an ambassador. After Grigon threatens to take the Communiverse by force, the ambassadors plan to return Elio to Earth for his safety. However, he chooses to negotiate with Grigon for immediate induction as an ambassador. Ooooo creates a clone of Elio to take his place about the prior fight.

Meanwhile in Hylurg, Elio attempts to negotiate with Grigon, using notes he had compiled from a Universal User's Manual's advice. Elio unintentionally angers Grigon by implying that he is a bad father and is then imprisoned. While trying to escape, he comes across Grigon's son, **Glordon**, and decides to use him as a last-resort bargaining chip to get Grigon to leave the Communiverse alone. They head back to the Communiverse, and Grigon agrees to leave them in peace in exchange for Glordon's safe return.

While Grigon is busy preparing his son's battle suit, called a carapace, Elio and Glordon explore the Communiverse for fun. They confide in each other; Elio feels alone and misunderstood by his aunt, while Glordon resists becoming a war machine like his father. Elio devises a cloning plan to keep them together. He puts the real Glordon on an escape shuttle and gives Grigon the fake one.

Back on Earth, Olga suspects that the clone is not her real nephew. She takes notes on his behavior, reads books on alien abductions, and finally attempts to look at one of the clone's hairs under a microscope. The hair escapes her grasp and returns to the clone, leading Olga to peel back his eye patch, revealing that there is no eye underneath; the clone agrees to tell the truth.

Grigon quickly recognizes Glordon's clone as fake since he knows his son and uses Questa's mind-reading powers to locate the real Glordon but also reveals who Elio really is. Grigon sends troops to find his son, meanwhile, Glordon accidentally activates the shuttle, heading toward Earth. Questa is saddened by Elio's deception, and when Grigon fails to locate Glordon, she returns Elio home despite his objections while the rest of the Communiverse is taken captive.

Back home, Elio is devastated but soon spots his aunt on the beach looking for him with Other Elio. After reconciling with Olga, who confirms his identity through his recovered eye injury, they head to the military base, where Elio's shuttle has been contained. Now that he is unneeded, Other Elio takes advantage of his decomposition process to distract the military, sacrificing himself while Elio and Olga sneak into the base to find Glordon dying in the shuttle. They attempt to return to the Communiverse, but space debris obstructs their path. When Olga states that they could reach someone who has a ham radio, Elio calls Bryce, and the two reconcile before Bryce passes them over to Melmac. Melmac informs them of the velocities and positions of the space debris, helping them dodge. Once the shuttle is out of Melmac's range, ham operators from around the world help the pair complete their journey.

Reaching the Communiverse, they return Glordon to his father, who rips his suit open to swaddle him, saving his life. Grigon apologizes to his son and the ambassadors, while Elio is welcomed back into the Communiverse. However, Elio has come to accept Olga as his family and Earth as his home. Determined to give the world a chance, he declines becoming an ambassador but states that he will someday before bidding everyone goodbye. Questa reminds him he is never alone before sending him and Olga home.

## Production

The film was announced on **September 9, 2022**, during the **D23 Expo**, with Adrian Molina set to write and direct. Yonas Kibreab and America Ferrera were also announced to voice the leading roles of Elio and his mother Olga Solis, respectively.

On **August 9, 2024**, during the **Disney D23 fan event**, Domee Shi and Madeline Sharafian were announced as the new directors, replacing Molina. Molina, however, is reportedly retaining his director credit nevertheless because of the amount of work he directed that is being kept in the film. Pete Docter also revealed that Ferrera had dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, with Zoë Saldaña taking over the character of Olga, who is now being reworked as Elio's aunt.

## Release

*Elio* was originally scheduled to be released in theaters in the United States on **March 1, 2024**, by **Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures**, but was delayed to **June 13, 2025**, because of the **2023 SAG-AFTRA strike**. According to Pete Docter, the film's delay was also related to the leadership change on the film as well as other projects at Pixar. On **February 14, 2025**, it was delayed to one week later to avoid competition with the live-action remake of *How to Train Your Dragon*.

The first teaser trailer for the film was released on **June 13, 2023**.
A second teaser trailer was released on **November 21, 2024**.
The official trailer was released on **March 19, 2025**.
