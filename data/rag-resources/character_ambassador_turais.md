## Background

### Official Description
*Ambassador Turais is a fearful, high-strung space diplomat. She’s the first to panic when things go awry.*  

“*Turais is a great example of the varied characters artists designed for the Communiverse,*” says producer **Mary Alice Drumm**.  
“*We challenged ourselves to try to lean away from bipedal, humanoid aliens and explore different shapes. Turais’ singular eye and ‘fish-wizard’-like shape make her one of our favorite aliens.*”

## Personality

Turais is characterized by her **nervous, anxious, and overly cautious temperament**.  
She tends to panic in stressful situations, often expecting the worst outcomes before others do.  
Despite her fearful nature, Turais remains a well-meaning and cooperative member of the **Communiverse Council**, striving to fulfill her diplomatic duties to the best of her ability.  
Her tendency to overreact contrasts sharply with the calm rationality of other ambassadors like **Tegmen**, which adds a touch of comedic tension during council scenes.

## Physical Appearance

Turais resembles a **purple, squid-like alien** with a tall, slender body.  
She has a **single yellow eye** that gives her a perpetual look of surprise or concern, and **small, thin arms** that enhance her anxious visual design.  
Her overall shape has been described as a hybrid between a sea creature and a wizardly silhouette, emphasizing her eccentric and otherworldly nature.
