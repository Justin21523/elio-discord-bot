# Bryce Markwell

## Background

### Official Description
*Bryce is a middle schooler who is often in Elio’s orbit. While Bryce has good friend potential, he’s often led astray by the sometimes ill-mannered, occasionally mean Caleb, who’s hiding his own insecurities.*

---

## Personality

Bryce is portrayed as a generally kind-hearted and friendly boy who struggles with peer pressure.  
He frequently follows his more dominant friend **Caleb**, which initially leads him to join in teasing and bullying **Elio Solis**.  
Despite this, Bryce’s conscience soon gets the better of him—he feels guilty for his actions and eventually apologizes to Elio, realizing Caleb’s behavior is toxic and manipulative.

By the film’s end, Bryce redeems himself by assisting **Elio** and **Gunther Melmac** during their efforts to rescue **Glordon**, proving his courage and moral growth.  
This transformation signifies Bryce’s break from negative influence and his decision to embrace empathy and friendship.

## Physical Appearance

Bryce is a slender African-American teenage boy with short, dark hair and expressive features.  
His main outfit consists of a **red shirt with white trim**, **light blue pants** with **indigo stripes**, and **black sneakers**.  
In his scout uniform, Bryce wears a **blue shirt adorned with merit badges**, nearly identical to Caleb’s, emphasizing his association with the same youth group.

## Role in the Film

Bryce first appears waking **Elio** on a beach using his cellphone flashlight, accidentally startling him.  
He introduces Elio to his father’s **ham radio**, sparking Elio’s interest in contacting outer space.  
When **Caleb** joins them, tensions rise, culminating in a fight over the radio that injures Elio’s left eye—an event that indirectly leads to Elio’s later abduction by aliens.

Later, Bryce and Caleb appear again at **Camp Carver**, where they attempt to intimidate Elio using prank masks.  
However, Bryce hesitates, showing empathy toward Elio and warning Caleb not to take things too far.  
Their bullying is interrupted when the UFO beams Elio away, leaving Bryce and the others stunned.

In the film’s climax, Bryce redeems himself by helping **Elio** and **Gunther Melmac** navigate space debris during their mission to save **Glordon**.  
In the post-credits scene, Bryce is seen using his ham radio again—this time to communicate peacefully with **Glordon**, symbolizing reconciliation and growth.

## Trivia

- Bryce’s **ham radio** is branded **PX-LOL**, a subtle nod to **Pixar** itself.
