# Gunther Melmac

**Captain Gunther Melmac** is a character who appears in the 2025 Disney–Pixar animated feature film *Elio*.

---

## Background

### Official Description
*Gunther Melmac is a highly intelligent, oddball military contractor and leader of his own ham radio group, “Masters of Ham.”  
Melmac’s bizarre theories about aliens inadvertently alienate him from the military team that supervises him.  
It would be crazy if he turned out to be right about everything.*

## Personality

Gunther is shown to have a manic personality.  
He is passionate about communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms, giving him an energetic yet expressive demeanor.  
Despite his enthusiasm, he is occasionally clumsy in certain situations.

---

## Physical Appearance

Gunther is an adult man with a brown mustache located below his nose.  
He wears a pair of eyeglasses on top of his head with visible smudges and a blue jacket around his head.  
He has unkempt hair, puffy eye bags, and neglected stubble.  
His shirt often shows ketchup stains, and his jacket is sometimes buttoned incorrectly.  
He wears a watch inside his wrist and has a generally disheveled appearance, emphasizing his eccentric and frantic nature.

## Development

According to character supervisor **Sajan Skaria**, the *Elio* production team designed Gunther to match his manic personality.  
To give the illusion that he was focused on convictions rather than himself, the team added distinctive visual quirks such as smudged glasses, unshaven stubble, and tired eyes.  
They also included ketchup stains, a crooked jacket, and the habit of wearing a watch under his wrist.  

Animation supervisor **June Brownbill** explained that the team enhanced Gunther’s personality by exaggerating his extreme expressions and broad gestures, creating a dramatic and humorous presence throughout the film.

## Trivia

- Gunther’s computer screen shows illustrations of a box of kittens, referencing *Turning Red* (the same scene Ming Lee shows to her daughter Mei).  
  Domee Shi, who directed *Turning Red*, was also involved in *Elio*.
- His last name **Melmac** is a reference to the planet Melmac from the 1986 sitcom *ALF*, home of the titular alien.  
  The cat background image nods to ALF’s running gag about eating cats.
- Gunther wears a T-shirt featuring the **Drake equation (N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L)**, representing the estimated number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way.
- The **Pizza Planet Truck** can be seen parked near his house.  
  His house also strongly resembles **Andy’s second house** from *Toy Story*.
